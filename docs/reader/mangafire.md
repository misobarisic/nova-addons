# MangaFire native source

`reader-addons/mangafire` is a separately installable Reader format-2 package,
version 1.0.1, contract `nova-reader1`, API `^1.0`. It is a JavaScript port of
Keiyoushi's implementation, not an APK/JAR loader. Exact upstream revision,
paths, modifications and Apache-2.0 text are retained in the package's
[NOTICE](../../reader-addons/mangafire/NOTICE.md) and
[LICENSE](../../reader-addons/mangafire/LICENSE).

## Install and select

```sh
python3 /path/to/published-reader/tools/package-addon.py reader-addons/mangafire /tmp/mangafire-1.0.1.zip
/path/to/nova-reader install-addon /tmp/mangafire-1.0.1.zip
```

In Browse, turn on **Show adult sources** and select MangaFire's desired language.
Upstream classifies this catalogue as mixed. Reader's binary content-warning
field is conservatively `nsfw: true` for the entire package and each variant.
The native port defaults to **Safe**, rather than upstream's all-content default.
Source Settings exposes `contentRating` (`safe`, `suggestive`, `erotica`,
`pornographic`, `all`), volume preference, edition merging and official-edition
preference. Existing entries and image bytes are not automatically reclassified
or removed when that setting changes.

Explicit source IDs are `mangafire.en`, `mangafire.es`, `mangafire.es-419`,
`mangafire.fr`, `mangafire.ja`, `mangafire.pt`, and `mangafire.pt-BR`. English
is the API fallback. Latin American Spanish maps to API code `es-la`; Brazilian
Portuguese maps to `pt-br`. All variants share their package's profile settings.

## Behavior and request protocol

Popular and latest query `/api/titles` with `order[views_30d]=desc` and
`order[chapter_updated_at]=desc`, respectively. Listings preserve API order and
use `meta.hasNext`, independently of item count. Text search and filters combine,
matching the pinned source. Author/artist lookup uses `/api/tags`; an unmatched
author yields a legitimate empty result. Type, content rating, genre inclusion/
exclusion, theme, status, AND/OR match mode, year bounds, minimum chapters and
sort definitions retain the upstream values.

Every API request uses the upstream three-stage VRF signature: stable sorting by
query key, indexed repeated `[]` parameters in the signed cleartext, UTF-8 bytes,
three substitution/XOR-feedback stages, and URL-safe unpadded Base64. This is
implemented in `vrf.js` without extra host primitives. It does not solve captchas.
No browser code, WebView asset or OpenCV solver is included. In this pinned
implementation `getPageList` returns `data.pages[].url` directly; `PageDto`
contains no scramble key and there is no image decode/descramble interceptor.
`VrfSigner` changes `/api/` requests only. This port therefore does not assume
the image scrambling used by some older MangaFire implementations.

Series IDs are `/title/<hid>` and omit mutable title slugs. Retrieval URLs retain
the current slug. Details include description, authors, type/genre/theme and
status. Chapter pages are enumerated sequentially with language, descending
number sort and `limit=200`, preserving server order and distinct edition IDs.
Decimal numbers remain strings in Reader DTOs; integer IDs received as JSON
strings remain strings. Optional merging groups by displayed chapter number,
uses the chosen official-edition preference and sorts descending, following
upstream. It is off by default so editions remain distinct. Volume preference
uses matching-language volumes, falling back to chapters only when the API has
no volumes at all, as upstream does.

Chapter/page identities do not contain image tokens. Page descriptors preserve
API order, include dimensions when supplied, and carry a title/chapter Referer.
Rust owns image bytes and source/profile sessions. Permissions cover
`mangafire.to` and the CDN suffixes `mfcdn.nl` and `mfcdn1.xyz`, including child
hosts. These suffixes were observed in safe live metadata on 2026-11-01.
Unexpected image hosts fail with `ParseChanged`; a new suffix requires a
permission-reviewed package update. Redirect and HTTPS/header policy remain
host-enforced. No arbitrary domain or custom-cookie setting is exposed.

HTTP 401, 403/captcha markup, 404, 429 and server failures become
`AuthenticationRequired`, `ChallengeRequired`, `NotFound`, `RateLimited` and
`Network`, respectively. Changed API fields/non-JSON responses become
`ParseChanged`. Interactive captcha solving/session transfer is unavailable;
the port never claims a challenge bypass. Upstream's optional auto-solver and
Android-specific client interceptors are not ported.

The host's per-operation limits still apply: at most 12 metadata requests,
2 MiB aggregate metadata and bounded QuickJS execution. A chapter catalogue over
12 API pages (11 after a volume probe) fails explicitly before fetching a partial
list. This is a current large-series limitation, not a complete-list success.
The upstream client rate-limit interceptor is not replicated in JavaScript;
429 responses are explicit and retry remains a user action.

## Catalogue identity

The live Keiyoushi gzip index fetched on 2026-11-01 had compressed SHA-256
`acaae63ab34af917e45687bbac4eedf160dc1f110c8084d84721b5eaafe17c4f`. Its exact
MangaFire extension record and repository metadata are retained in
the [historical Reader 0.1.26 fixture](https://github.com/misobarisic/nova-reader/blob/v0.1.26/crates/reader-catalogue/fixtures/keiyoushi-mangafire.pb.gz)
(deterministic gzip mtime 0). Package `eu.kanade.tachiyomi.extension.all.mangafire`,
version `1.6.35`/code `106035`, declares mixed content warning `2`. The checked-in
port mappings use the actual decimal-string IDs below; knowing a mapping alone
does not publish an addon or make it available in a trusted native catalogue.

| Language | Upstream source ID | Native source ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| en | `6084907896154116083` | `mangafire.en` |
| es | `8098539940032331958` | `mangafire.es` |

## Verification

The original port compared MangaFire and Kagane at immutable Keiyoushi revision
`0d83f6be79e12b0a8b6c6f20a500c0e9456c222a`. Both are now independently packaged
under `reader-addons/`; each package's notice records its current upstream pin.

Required tests are network-free and use newly authored neutral JSON only:

```sh
node reader-addons/mangafire/tests/parser.test.mjs
cargo test --locked --manifest-path reader-tests/Cargo.toml --test mangafire
```

The Node test checks signer vectors and request/result rules. Actual-host Rust
tests install the real ZIP content and execute it in QuickJS, covering languages,
settings, author lookup, paginated/duplicate chapters, volume fallback, stable
identities, dimensions, CDN/header handling, HTTP/challenge errors, changed
markup, cancellation and the chapter-request budget. Placeholder page transport
returns inert bytes; these fixtures make no claim about live image decoding.
The manual test is opt-in and never fetches image bytes:

```sh
cargo test --locked --manifest-path reader-tests/Cargo.toml --test mangafire live_safe_metadata_smoke -- --ignored --nocapture
```

Safe live probes on 2026-11-01 confirmed HTTP 200 and the expected API schema for
listing, details, chapters and page descriptors. They fetched no image bytes.
The opt-in smoke through the production Reader host was also attempted: it
failed before listing with `Network("DNS deadline")` during host DNS preflight.
Thus the successful proxy-based HTTP probes do not establish a successful native
Reader live session. Live download/decode/device reading and future challenge
availability remain unverified. Native version 1.0.1 is independent of upstream versionCode 35.
Canonical sources and synthetic tests live in this Nova Addons repository.
